This project is a research engine. Every research project has its own directory.
Each directory contains a `README.md` file that describes the project and its structure.
A research project is a collection of Markdown files that explore a hypothesis or research question.

The README file is structured as follows:
- A hypothesis or research question
- A table of contents in the README.md file, referencing each Markdown file in the project (initially empty)
- A backlog of items to research next with checkboxes to track progress
