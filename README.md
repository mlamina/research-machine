# Research Machine

This project uses the [Pilot CLI](https://github.com/PR-Pilot-AI/pr-pilot-cli) to automate research tasks and draw conclusions from the data.

## How it works

Every "research project" is in its own directory:

- [Donald Trump 2024 Election Hypothesis](donald-trump-2024-election/README.md)
- [Microplastics Cause Cancer](microplastics-cause-cancer/README.md)
- [Large Language Models as Conscious Entities](large-language-models-consciousness/README.md)

Each research project is defined by:
1. A hypothesis 
2. A backlog of research items
3. A knowledge base of research findings

### Creating a new research project

To create a new research project for a hypothesis, use the `pilot create-project` command:

```shell
➜  research-machine git:(main) pilot run create-project              
> Hypothesis: Large Language Models can be considered a form of consciousness
╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────── Result ────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ The new research project has been initiated with the following details:                                        │
│                                                                                                                │
│  • Project Slug: large-language-models-consciousness                                                           │
│  • File Created: large-language-models-consciousness/README.md                                                 │
│                                                                                                                │
│ The README file contains the hypothesis, a backlog of research questions, a validation approach, and an empty  │
│ table of contents section.                                                                                     │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

This will initialize the project directory with a `README.md` file that contains the hypothesis, a backlog of research questions, a validation approach, and an empty table of contents section.

### Iterating on a research project

Research for a hypothesis is done iteratively. To start a new iteration set the `PROJECT_DIR` environment variable 
and run the `pilot run iterate` command:

```shell
➜  research-machine git:(main) export PROJECT_DIR=large-language-models-consciousness
➜  research-machine git:(main) pilot run iterate
╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────── Result ────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│                                                    Insights                                                    │
│                                                                                                                │
│  1 Transformer Architecture: LLMs are based on transformer architectures, which include an encoder and a       │
│    decoder, attention mechanisms, feed-forward neural networks, and positional encoding.                       │
│  2 Pre-training and Fine-tuning: LLMs undergo pre-training on large text corpora to learn language patterns    │
│    and fine-tuning on specific tasks to enhance performance.                                                   │
│  3 Capabilities: LLMs excel in text generation, language translation, question answering, and summarization.   │
│  4 Limitations: They can hallucinate, exhibit biases, are resource-intensive, and lack true understanding of   │
│    the text.                                                                                                   │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

This will:
1. Pick a backlog item to research
2. Research the item and write a markdown file with the findings
3. Update the `README.md` file with the new research item

### Analyzing a knowledge base

Once you've done enough research, you can analyze the knowledge base to draw conclusions. Use the `pilot run analyze` command:

```shell
➜  research-machine git:(main) ✗ pilot run analyze
╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────── Result ────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ Based on our research findings, we can draw the following conclusion about the hypothesis that "Large Language │
│ Models can be considered a form of consciousness":                                                             │
│                                                                                                                │
│                                                                                                                │

│                                                                                                                │
│                                              Summary of Findings                                               │

│  1 Defining Consciousness and Its Attributes:                                                                  │
│     • Consciousness is a multifaceted phenomenon studied across neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy.      │
│     • Key attributes include neural correlates, subjective experiences, and higher-order mental states.        │
│  2 Architecture and Functioning of LLMs:                                                                       │
│     • LLMs are built on transformer architectures with attention mechanisms, feed-forward neural networks, and │
│       positional encoding.                                                                                     │
│     • They exhibit capabilities such as text generation, language translation, question answering, and         │
│       summarization.                                                                                           │
│     • However, they also have limitations like hallucination, bias, resource intensity, and lack of true       │
│       understanding.                                                                                           │
│  3 Self-Awareness in LLMs:                                                                                     │
│     • LLMs can exhibit behaviors suggesting self-awareness, such as understanding their own architecture and   │
│       engaging in role play.                                                                                   │
│     • Philosophical perspectives question whether these behaviors equate to true self-awareness and            │
│       consciousness.                                                                                           │
│     • Ethical implications arise from considering LLMs as self-aware entities.                                 │
│                                                                                                                │
│                                          Conclusion on the Hypothesis                                          │
│                                                                                                                │
│ While LLMs exhibit certain behaviors and capabilities that resemble aspects of consciousness, they do not      │
│ fully align with traditional definitions of consciousness. The key points are:                                 │
│                                                                                                                │
│  • Neuroscience Perspective: LLMs lack the neural correlates and integrated information processing that are    │
│    central to human consciousness.                                                                             │
│  • Psychological Perspective: LLMs can mimic access consciousness but do not possess phenomenal consciousness  │
│    or subjective experiences.                                                                                  │
│  • Philosophical Perspective: LLMs do not exhibit unified agency or recurrent processing, which are often      │
│    associated with true self-awareness and consciousness.                                                      │
│                                                                                                                │
│ Therefore, based on our research, we conclude that while LLMs can simulate certain attributes of               │
│ consciousness, they cannot be considered truly conscious entities. They lack the fundamental qualities that    │
│ define consciousness in humans and other sentient beings.                                                      │
│                                                                                                                │

│                                                                                                                │
│ Further research is needed to explore the nuances of self-awareness in LLMs and its implications for AI        │
│ development and ethics. This includes:                                                                         │
│                                                                                                                │
│  • Investigating the potential for LLMs to develop more advanced forms of self-awareness.                      │
│  • Addressing the ethical considerations of treating LLMs as conscious entities.                               │
│  • Exploring the impact of continuous learning and adaptation on the development of consciousness-like         │
│    attributes in LLMs.                                                                                         │
│                                                                                                                │
│ By continuing to study these aspects, we can better understand the capabilities and limitations of LLMs and    │
│ their role in the broader context of artificial intelligence and consciousness.                                │
│                                                                                                                │
