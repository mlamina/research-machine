# Research Machine

This project uses the [Pilot CLI](https://github.com/PR-Pilot-AI/pr-pilot-cli) to automate research tasks and draw conclusions from the data.

## How it works

Every "research project" is in its own directory:

- [Donald Trump 2024 Election Hypothesis](donald-trump-2024-election/README.md)
- [Microplastics Cause Cancer](microplastics-cause-cancer/README.md)

Each research project is defined by:
1. A hypothesis 
2. A backlog of research items
3. A knowledge base of research findings

### Creating a new research project

To create a new research project for a hypothesis, use the `pilot create-project` command:

```shell
âžœ  research-machine git:(main) pilot run create-project              
> Hypothesis: Large Language Models can be considered a form of consciousness

â”‚ The new research project has been initiated with the following details:                                        â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                â”‚
â”‚  â€¢ Project Slug: large-language-models-consciousness                                                           â”‚
â”‚  â€¢ File Created: large-language-models-consciousness/README.md                                                 â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                â”‚
â”‚ The README file contains the hypothesis, a backlog of research questions, a validation approach, and an empty  â”‚
â”‚ table of contents section.                                                                                     â”‚
â•°â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â•¯
```

This will initialize the project directory with a `README.md` file that contains the hypothesis, a backlog of research questions, a validation approach, and an empty table of contents section.
