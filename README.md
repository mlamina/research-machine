# Research Machine

This project uses the [Pilot CLI](https://github.com/PR-Pilot-AI/pr-pilot-cli) to automate research tasks and draw conclusions from the data.

## How it works

Every "research project" is in its own directory:

- [Donald Trump 2024 Election Hypothesis](donald-trump-2024-election/README.md)
- [Microplastics Cause Cancer](microplastics-cause-cancer/README.md)

Each research project is defined by:
1. A hypothesis 
2. A backlog of research items
3. A knowledge base of research findings

### Creating a new research project

To create a new research project, use the `pilot create-project` command:

```shell
