We want to do research for one of our projects. Do the following:

1. Read `{{ project }}/README.md` to understand the hypothesis and progress so far
2. Pick an item from the backlog
3. Research online and write a markdown file with your findings in the `{{ project }}` directory
4. Remove the backlog item in from `{{ project }}/README.md`
5. Update the table of contents in `{{ project }}/README.md` with a Markdown link to the new file
6. Respond with a short list of the insights you gained from this iteration
