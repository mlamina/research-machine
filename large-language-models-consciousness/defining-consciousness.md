# Defining Consciousness and Its Attributes

## Introduction
Consciousness is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that has been the subject of extensive study and debate across various fields, including neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy. This document explores different definitions and attributes of consciousness from these disciplines, summarizing key points and perspectives.

## Neuroscience Perspectives
Neuroscience aims to understand consciousness by identifying its neural correlates, often referred to as Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCCs). These are specific brain states or processes that correlate with conscious experience. Key points include:

- **Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCCs)**: Identifying specific brain regions and neural activities associated with conscious experience (Crick & Koch, 1990).
- **Global Workspace Theory**: Proposes that consciousness arises from the integration of information across different brain regions (Baars, 1988).
- **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**: Suggests that consciousness corresponds to the capacity of a system to integrate information (Tononi, 2004).

## Psychological Perspectives
Psychology approaches consciousness by examining subjective experiences and cognitive processes. Key points include:

- **Access Consciousness**: Refers to the ability to access and report on mental states (Block, 1995).
- **Phenomenal Consciousness**: Involves the qualitative, subjective aspects of conscious experience, often described as 'what it is like' to be in a particular mental state (Nagel, 1974).
- **Higher-Order Theories**: Suggest that consciousness arises when a mental state is the object of another mental state (Rosenthal, 2005).

## Philosophical Perspectives
Philosophy delves into the conceptual and existential aspects of consciousness. Key points include:

- **The Hard Problem of Consciousness**: Coined by David Chalmers, this problem addresses why and how physical processes in the brain give rise to subjective experience (Chalmers, 1995).
- **Dualism vs. Physicalism**: Dualism posits that mind and body are distinct, while physicalism argues that consciousness arises from physical processes (Descartes, 1641; Churchland, 1981).
- **Panpsychism**: The view that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous aspect of the universe (Strawson, 2006).

## Conclusion
Understanding consciousness requires a multidisciplinary approach, integrating insights from neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy. Each field offers unique perspectives and contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of this enigmatic phenomenon.
