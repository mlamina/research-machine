# Research Question 4: Is there any existing evidence linking microplastics to cancer?

## Introduction

The potential link between microplastics and cancer has been a growing concern in recent years. Microplastics, which are tiny plastic particles less than 5mm in size, have been found in various environments, including water, air, and food. These particles can enter the human body through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact. Once inside the body, microplastics can interact with biological tissues and potentially cause adverse health effects, including cancer.

## Existing Evidence

### Accumulation in Cancer Cells

A study published on LiveScience suggests that microplastics may accumulate in cancer cells and potentially aid in their spread. The research indicates that microplastics can persist in the body longer than previously thought, raising concerns about their long-term health impacts.

### Gastrointestinal Tract Exposure

Research published in Springer highlights that the persistent presence of microplastics in the gastrointestinal tract can lead to prolonged exposure to adsorbed pollutants. This prolonged exposure amplifies the potential for adverse health effects, including cancer. However, direct evidence linking microplastic exposure to digestive system cancers in humans is currently limited.

### Biological Samples

A review article on NCBI discusses the presence of microplastics in various biological samples such as feces, sputum, saliva, blood, and placenta. The review mentions that microplastics have been associated with several health issues, including cancer, intestinal, pulmonary, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases.

## Conclusion

While there is growing evidence suggesting a potential link between microplastics and cancer, direct evidence in humans remains limited. More research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms through which microplastics may contribute to cancer development and to establish a definitive causal relationship.
