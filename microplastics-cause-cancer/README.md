# Microplastics Cause Cancer

## Hypothesis

Microplastics cause cancer.

## Backlog

2. **Microplastics and Immune System Response**: Explore how the presence of microplastics in the body might affect the immune system and its ability to detect and destroy cancer cells.
3. **Comparative Study of Microplastic Exposure**: Compare cancer rates in populations with high and low levels of microplastic exposure.
4. **Longitudinal Studies on Microplastic Exposure**: Conduct long-term studies to observe the effects of chronic microplastic exposure on cancer development.
5. **Microplastics in Food and Water Supply**: Assess the levels of microplastics in various food and water sources and their potential link to cancer.
6. **Effectiveness of Microplastic Filtration Systems**: Evaluate the effectiveness of current filtration systems in removing microplastics from drinking water and their impact on cancer rates.

## Validation Approach

Answering these research questions will help validate or invalidate the hypothesis by:

- Providing a comprehensive understanding of what microplastics are and how they interact with the human body.
- Identifying any existing evidence or gaps in the current research linking microplastics to cancer.
- Exploring the biological mechanisms that could explain a causal relationship between microplastics and cancer.
- Assessing the levels of microplastic exposure in different environments and their potential health impacts.
- Evaluating the effectiveness of current detection methods and regulatory measures in addressing microplastic pollution.
