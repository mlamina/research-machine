# Microplastics Cause Cancer

## Hypothesis

Microplastics cause cancer.

## Backlog

1. **Research Question 7:** How do different concentrations of microplastics affect human health?
2. **Research Question 8:** What are the current methods for detecting and measuring microplastics in the human body?
3. **Research Question 9:** What are the potential sources of microplastic contamination?
4. **Research Question 10:** What are the regulatory and policy responses to microplastic pollution?

## Validation Approach

Answering these research questions will help validate or invalidate the hypothesis by:

- Providing a comprehensive understanding of what microplastics are and how they interact with the human body.
- Identifying any existing evidence or gaps in the current research linking microplastics to cancer.
- Exploring the biological mechanisms that could explain a causal relationship between microplastics and cancer.
- Assessing the levels of microplastic exposure in different environments and their potential health impacts.
- Evaluating the effectiveness of current detection methods and regulatory measures in addressing microplastic pollution.
