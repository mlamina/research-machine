# Research Question 2: How do microplastics enter the human body?

Microplastics, defined as plastic particles less than 5 mm in diameter, and nanoplastics, less than 1 Î¼m in diameter, can enter the human body through several key routes:

## 1. Inhalation

Airborne microplastics originate from urban dust, synthetic textiles, and rubber tires. These particles can be inhaled and enter the respiratory system. Studies have shown that microplastics are present in the air we breathe, especially in urban environments.

## 2. Ingestion

Microplastics can be ingested through contaminated food and water. They have been found in various food items, including shellfish, fish, and even bottled water. The particles may enter the water at the source, during treatment and distribution, or from packaging materials.

## 3. Skin Contact

Although less common, microplastics can also enter the body through skin contact. This can occur through the use of personal care products containing microplastics or through contact with contaminated water.
